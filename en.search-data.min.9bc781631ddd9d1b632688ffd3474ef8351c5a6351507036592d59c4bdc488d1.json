[{"id":0,"href":"/_about/","title":"Migrating from Jekyll","section":"Harpreet Singh","content":" Move static content to static # Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like\nâ–¾ \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/ â–¾ images/ logo.png should become\nâ–¾ \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/ â–¾ static/ â–¾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you\u0026rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.\nCreate your Hugo configuration file # Hugo can read your configuration as JSON, YAML or TOML. Hugo supports parameters custom configuration too. Refer to the Hugo configuration documentation for details.\nSet your configuration publish folder to _site # The default is for Jekyll to publish to _site and for Hugo to publish to public. If, like me, you have _site mapped to a git submodule on the gh-pages branch, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to do one of two alternatives:\nChange your submodule to point to map gh-pages to public instead of _site (recommended).\ngit submodule deinit _site git rm _site git submodule add -b gh-pages git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git public Or, change the Hugo configuration to use _site instead of public.\n{ .. \u0026quot;publishdir\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;_site\u0026quot;, .. } Convert Jekyll templates to Hugo templates # That\u0026rsquo;s the bulk of the work right here. The documentation is your friend. You should refer to Jekyll\u0026rsquo;s template documentation if you need to refresh your memory on how you built your blog and Hugo\u0026rsquo;s template to learn Hugo\u0026rsquo;s way.\nAs a single reference data point, converting my templates for heyitsalex.net took me no more than a few hours.\nConvert Jekyll plugins to Hugo shortcodes # Jekyll has plugins; Hugo has shortcodes. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly trivial to do a port.\nImplementation # As an example, I was using a custom image_tag plugin to generate figures with caption when running Jekyll.

Witnessing theories come to life in computer systems and algorithms has been truly captivating.\nWhat to Expect. # As someone with dynamic interests, my focus shifts based on current happenings. Primarily, my curiosity centers around the developments in the field of computer science. So this is a place where I would not only share algorithms and data structure problems but also research articles in the tech domain.
