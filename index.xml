      <description>Greetings! üëã # Introduction # Greetings, I&amp;rsquo;m Harpreet Singh, a Computer Science major at IIITH, finished my third semester. Having recently completed courses like CS3.301 (Operating Systems and Networks) and CS1.302 (Automata Theory), I find myself intrigued by the practical applications of Computer Science. Witnessing theories come to life in computer systems and algorithms has been truly captivating.&#xA;What to Expect. # As someone with dynamic interests, my focus shifts based on current happenings.</description>

      <description>Leetcode 371 # Sum of Two Integers # Problem Statement:&#xA;Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.&#xA;Logic # We would be treating a and b in binary form for understanding bit operations. First bit of sum calculated by xor(0^1, 1^0, 0^0, 1^1), but for the addition such as 1+1 = 10 we must have some carry, which can be found by &amp;amp; operator between the two numbers.</description>

      <description>421. Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array # Approach # I. Naive(O(n^2))[TLE‚ùå] # We can try to find the maximum xor by brute force, i.e., for every pair (a, b) we calculate x and maximize it.&#xA;Code # class Solution { public: int findMaximumXOR(vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&amp;amp; nums) { int maxi = 0; for(int i = 0; i &amp;lt; nums.size() - 1; i++){ for(int j = i + 1; j &amp;lt; nums.</description>

      <title>8. String to Integer</title>

      <description>8. String to Integer # Problem Statement # Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++&amp;#39;s atoi function). The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows: Read in and ignore any leading whitespace. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is &amp;#39;-&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;+&amp;#39;. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively.</description>

      <title>Minimum flips to make xy string</title>

      <description>1. Minimum flips to make xy string # Problem Statement # You are given a string consisting of the letters x and y, such as xyxxxyxyy. In addition, you have an operation called flip, which changes a single x to y or vice versa. Determine how many times you would need to apply this operation to ensure that all x&amp;rsquo;s come before all y&amp;rsquo;s. In the preceding example, it suffices to flip the second and sixth characters, so you should return 2.</description>

      <description>Chess rating system # Introduction # A chess rating system is a system used in chess to estimate the strength of a player, based on their performance versus other players. They are used by organisations like FIDE, English Chess Federation and online chess websites like chess.com, Lichess only to name a few. In general for a player, their strength is determined by the rating, higher rating indicates more proficiency.</description>
