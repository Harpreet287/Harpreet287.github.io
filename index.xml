      <description>Leetcode 371 # Sum of Two Integers # Problem Statement:&#xA;Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.&#xA;Logic # We would be treating a and b in binary form for understanding bit operations. First bit of sum calculated by xor(0^1, 1^0, 0^0, 1^1), but for the addition such as 1+1 = 10 we must have some carry, which can be found by &amp;amp; operator between the two numbers.</description>

      <description>8. String to Integer # Problem Statement # Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++&amp;#39;s atoi function). The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows: Read in and ignore any leading whitespace. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is &amp;#39;-&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;+&amp;#39;. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively.</description>
